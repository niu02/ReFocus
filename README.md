# ReFocus
An app I created for a university project and to help familiarise myself with C#. 
The aim was to provide a short-term timed distraction (timer set by the user), for individuals with ADHD that may struggle maintaining focus on a task, with the choice of a puzzle, game, and/or quiz, to aid re-focusing on the task again afterwards due to a mental refresh.
